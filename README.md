# Guess CLI

A whimsical command-line number guessing game, wherein the Bard's own spirit doth animate the terminal!
The computer hath pondered a secret numeral 'twixt 1 and 100, and thou, O valiant guesser,
must divine it within a scant measure of attempts.

## Features

- Three degrees of peril: Easy, Medium, and Hard
- Thy finest feats (fewest guesses) for each peril are etched eternally in `score.json`.
- Mark the fleeting seconds from first conjecture to crowning glory.
- After conquest or calamity, choose to spin fortune's wheel anew.

## Installation

Ensure Python 3.11 or higher graces thy realm.
```
git clone https://github.com/kr4us3r/guess-cli.git
cd guess-cli
pip install .
```

## Usage

1. `guess-cli` to commence the spectacle.
2. Elect thy peril: 1 for Easy, 2 for Medium, 3 for Hard.
3. Hurl thy conjectures (1-100); the oracle shall whisper if 'tis "higher than the stars" or "lower than the roots".
4. Triumph? Bask in laurels and temporal measure. Falter? The secret is unveiled in sorrowful mercy.

### A Glimpse of the Revels
```
Hail, good wanderer! Welcome to this merry trial of wit.
I have conceivèd in my mind a secret number betwixt one and a full hundred.
Thou shalt divine it with but few guesses, ere fortune turn her wheel against thee.

Now choose thy path upon this stage of chance:
1. Easy (10 guesses, for the gentle novice)
2. Medium (5 guesses, for the steadfast heart)
3. Hard (3 guesses, for the bold and valiant soul)

Speak thy choice, fair guesser: 1

Vent thy conjecture: 50
Alas, too high! My number lieth lower than 50, in humbler fields.

Speak thy guess boldly: 25
Too low, good soul! It dwelleth higher than 25, upon loftier ground.

... (The plot thickens)

Triumph! Thou hast divined my secret in but 6 ventures!
Thy wit hath conquered in 12.52 fleeting seconds of mortal time.

A new laurel crowns thy brow! Thou hast surpassed all former feats at Easy difficulty with mere 6 guesses.

Shall we tread this stage once more? Wilt thou hazard fortune again? [Y/n]:
